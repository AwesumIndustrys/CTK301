    <img src="img/Teeth.jpg" alt="A simplistic image of a person with clean teeth"/>
    <p>This poster has text on the top and bottom, saying "KEEP YOUR" and "TEETH CLEAN" respectively. At the top left there is a container of toothpaste, and at the bottom right there is a toothbrush. In the center is a man with no visible features, except for his straight white teeth. The goal of this image is to convice or even put pressure on people to brush their teeth and keep them nice and clean.</p>
